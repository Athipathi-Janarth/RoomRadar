#Problem Statement

Finding off-campus accommodation Â is a difficult endeavor for college students. There is no suitable website or app for people to utilize to find houses, roommates, or a place to stay temporarily before their long-term apartment move-in date. Most students utilize Facebook groups, WhatsApp, and Telegram, although there are many groups formed and not all students receive the information.



#Solution

Building a smartphone application to assist students seeking for both temporary and long-term housing is the goal of this project. Users/Students (hosts) may post their apartments along with the dates they will be open, and students can look for rooms that match their criteria, make reservations for short-term accommodation, or contact the host for long-term residences.
